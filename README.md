Developed a machine learning–based web application to predict the likelihood of diabetes using patient health parameters. The system uses data preprocessing, feature selection, and supervised learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions. The project focuses on healthcare analytics, model evaluation, and real-world applicability.

My Role in the Project

As a Machine Learning Developer, I was responsible for data collection, preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and integration of the prediction system. I implemented classification algorithms, optimized model performance, and ensured reliable prediction results.

• Designed and developed a diabetes prediction system using machine learning algorithms.
• Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
• Trained and evaluated models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
• Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and performance metrics.
• Implemented the prediction logic to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.
• Visualized results and model performance for better interpretability.
• Ensured model reliability and usability for healthcare-related decision support.
